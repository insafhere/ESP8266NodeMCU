# ESP8266NodeMCU

ESP8266 NodeMCU is well-known for its WIFI capabilities, but, there is only 1 analog input pin. Hence, typical circuit connection would not enable us to collect more than 1 analog input reading. However, there are 2 ways to get over this. One is to either get a multiplexer and or the simpler solution is to create a circuit that mimicks a multiplexer. In this repository, i will show you the code and circuit connection to mimick a multiplexer.

Overall for my circuit setup, there are 4 photoresistors in the circuit to collect analog input data. 220ohm resistors used to connect the photoresistors to GND. The number of photoresistors could be scaled up to the number of GPIO pins available in the NodeMCU.

**Below is the image of the setup:**

**Here is how the data would look like on Serial Monitor:**
