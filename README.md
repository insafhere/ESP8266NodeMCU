# ESP8266NodeMCU

ESP8266 NodeMCU is well-known for its WIFI capabilities, but, there is only 1 analog input pin. Hence, typical circuit connection would not enable us to collect more than 1 analog input reading. However, there are 2 ways to get over this. One is to either get a multiplexer and or the simpler solution is to create a circuit that mimicks a multiplexer. In this repository, i will show you the code and circuit connection to mimick a multiplexer.

Overall for my circuit setup, there is 3 photoresistors connected to collect analogo input data. The number of photoresistors could be scaled up to the number of GPIO pins available in the NodeMCU.

**Below is the image of the setup:**

**Here is how the data would look like on Serial Monitor:**
